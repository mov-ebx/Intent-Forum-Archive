## What is Intent Forum?

Intent Forum was the official forum for the website "intent.store".

The site hosted free & paid cheats for the video game Minecraft, and acted as a middleman between cheat creators and their users.

As of now, their website is dead. Their domain has expired and there seems to be no future for Intent.store.

Because of this, I've archived the entirety of the forums to preserve the it's history as ervices such as the Wayback Machine fail to capture each individual (if any) forum posts!
